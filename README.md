# cpp-games - Classic arcade games in C++

First of all, a developer's apology: I coded this when I was a child. I really can't get why on earth did I use C++ to make these games, but I'm actually very proud of it. (At least as proud as to be marking this repository as public.)

The recreated games are: Minesweeper, Pong, Arkanoid, Space, Snake, Pacman & Tetris.

There's also a misterious ```CppGame``` folder, which, if I remember properly, intended to be a mixture of all the other games. Something like playing Tetris with a Pong ball bouncing on the walls and pieces.

As a side note, ```CppTetris``` was actually ported to Arduino to make a "physical Tetris game" with a LED matrix as the board.
